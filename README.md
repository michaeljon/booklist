# CPSC-5200-01 Software Architecture and Design Outside Reading List

This is just a list of architecture and design books that are generally useful to have on your bookshelf. Most are recent, some are starting to show their age, and some are good for their historical perspective. I'll lump them into groups, but sometimes there are interesting intersections.

Quick note: Searching Amazon by ISBN isn't always possible. Use the full title name and author to narrow down your search if the ISBN results don't make sense.

## Software Architecture Patterns and Styles

This collection covers a number of reference books for understanding the generic styles and patterns of software architecture. The POSA books comprise a reasonably thorough overview of the patterns you will run across in the wild, so the list starts with them.

## Just some other general stuff you might want

**The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master**<br/>
Hunt, Andrew<br/>

**Programming Pearls (2nd Ed.)**<br/>
Bentley, Jon

**Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (1st ed.)**<br/>
Abelson, Harold<br/>
This is *the* book to start programming with, which is unfortunate because you've all started out the wrong way. But read this anyway. The first edition is much better in my opinion, but get either. This is available online and in print.<br/>

**The Algorithm Design Manual 2nd Edition**<br/>
Skiena, Steven<br/>
Get a book on algorithms and algorithm _design_ and read it.<br/>

**Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition**<br/>
Cormen, Thomas<br/>

**The Art of Computer Programming, Volumes 1-4A Boxed Set**<br/>
Knuth, Donald<br/>
This is the classic series on algorithm design. Buy it, read it, read it again.<br/>

**The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 4B, Fascicle 5: Mathematical Preliminaries Redux; Introduction to Backtracking; Dancing Links**<br/>
Knuth, Donald<br/>

**The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 4, Fascicle 6: Satisfiability**<br/>

**The MMIX Supplement: Supplement to The Art of Computer Programming Volumes 1, 2, 3**
Ruckert, Martin<br/>

**The Design of Everyday Things: Revised and Expanded Edition**<br/>
Norman, Don<br/>
This one isn't a computing text at all. It's a short book that talks about design and why the human being who uses your product is so important<br/>

**Hacker's Delight**<br/>
Warren, Henry<br/>

**Elements of Programming**<br/>
Stepanov, Alexander<br/>
This will be the hardest book you read from this list. But read it.<br/>

**Seven Languages in Seven Weeks: A Pragmatic Guide to Learning Programming Languages**<br/>
Tate, Bruce<br/>

**Seven More Languages in Seven Weeks: Languages That Are Shaping the Future**<br/>

## Networking

**Computer Networks, 5th ed**<br/>
Tanenbaum, Andrew<br/>
There are a number of editions of this book. I do not have a copy of the international edition. It's supposed to be identical the US hardcover edition. This book is expensive, see if you can get it on the used market. I have a 1st edition of this text and it still holds up at the lower layers in the ISO model.

The following three books are a series that walks from the bottom of the TCP/IP stack up through current application protocols. Do the coding exercises in them to get an undersatnding how the underlying networking software works. Plus, it's fun to write code in C that fiddles with the bits.

**TCP/IP Illustrated, Vol. 1: The Protocols**<br/>
Addison-Wesley<br/>
Stevens, W. Richard and Fall, Kevin R.

**TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 2: The Implementation**<br/>
Addison-Wesley<br/>
Stevens, W. Richard and Wright, Gary

**TCP/IP Illustrated: v. 3: TCP for Transactions, HTTP, NNTP and the Unix Domain Protocols**</br>
